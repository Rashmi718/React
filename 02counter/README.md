# 02 Counter

## Description

A React counter application that demonstrates state management using the `useState` hook. The app allows users to increment and decrement a counter value. The increment function increases the counter by 4 (with multiple state updates), while the decrement function decreases it by 1. The counter has boundaries - it cannot go below 0 or above 20, showcasing conditional state updates and React state management patterns.

## Features

- React `useState` hook for state management
